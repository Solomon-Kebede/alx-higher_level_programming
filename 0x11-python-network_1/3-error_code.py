'''
Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL
and displays the body of the response (decoded in `utf-8`).

    -You have to manage urllib.error.HTTPError exceptions and
    print: `Error code:` followed by the HTTP status code
    -You must use the packages `urllib` and `sys`
    -You are not allowed to import other packages than `urllib` and `sys`
    -You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
    -You must use the `with` statement

Please test your script in the sandbox provided, using the
web server running on port 5000

                print(res.read().decode())

            print(f'Error code: {e.status}')
